   * It's worth noting that this value isn't *exactly* a `repeat`. Instead, it uses Reanimated's `withRepeat` function under the hood, which repeats back to the **previous value**. If you want a repeated animation, I recommend setting it to `true` from the start, and make sure you have a `from` value.
   *
   * As a result, this value cannot be reliably changed on the fly. If you would like animations to repeat based on the `from` value, `repeat` must be a number when the component initializes. You can set it to `0` to stop it, but you won't be able to start it again. You might be better off using the sequence array API if you need to update its repetitiveness on the fly.
